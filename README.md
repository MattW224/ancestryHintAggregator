# Ancestry Hint Aggregator

This plugin enables Ancestry users to view all tree hints from a particular record collection. Under each hint, a "View all hints in this collection" hyperlink will appear. However, this appears only on the "All Hints" page. To access that page, click the leaf icon in the upper-right corner, and select "See all hints in..."
